      <h1>Algorithm</h1>
      <p>An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions or rules designed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task. In computer science and mathematics, algorithms are used for data processing, calculations, and automated reasoning. They are fundamental to programming and are used in various applications, from simple calculations to complex systems like artificial intelligence and machine learning. An algorithm typically takes an input, processes it through a series of steps, and produces an output.</p>
